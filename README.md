# Tank Game (need name)

## New Features!
  - our BIG features will go here
  - in the meantime, features are being added all the time, we don't need to update this.
  - in the future, each major change will upbring a new version.

## Development
Javascript does not enable you to see a live preview of the game locally, it requires us to set up a server.

In order to do this:
1. get this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en
2. search and open "web server" from windows search bar
3. choose folder as our repository, "tank-game"
4. click Web Server URL, "http://127.0.0.1:8887"
